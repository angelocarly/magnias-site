# A world of shapes

I keep stumbling back to geometry. There is something fascinating about how these very visual relations have such a beauty.

There's a very big mathematical world describing shapes. You have the wondrous world of polytopes, where point-vertex-face shapes get mathematically described. Another world is fractal geometry where infinite self-similar shapes repeat in eachother.
