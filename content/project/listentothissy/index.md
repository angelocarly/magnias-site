description: "A bot that creates Spotify playlists based on Discord messages"
---

A Discord bot written in the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org). Inspired by the [r/listentothis](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis) subreddit where people share interesting, and relative unknown music.

I host an instance of the bot and have connected it to my Discord server, here it checks for new songs that me and my friends share. The playlist made from these can be found [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0j2PpLzQD4d1y3ZkeJFVqa?si=ea2839a5c32b4191).

You can view the source code on my [Github repo](https://github.com/angelocarly/listentothissy).
